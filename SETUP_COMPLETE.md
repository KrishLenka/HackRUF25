# ✅ Setup Complete!

## What Was the Problem?

**Issue**: The `pip` command wasn't found because:
1. Your virtual environment wasn't properly created
2. Python packages couldn't be installed system-wide (protected by macOS/Homebrew)

**Solution**: 
1. Created a proper Python virtual environment (`venv`)
2. Activated it so `pip` commands work correctly
3. Installed all required packages for training

## ✅ What's Installed

Your environment now has:
- **PyTorch 2.8.0** with Apple Silicon GPU support (MPS)
- **torchvision 0.23.0** for image processing
- **timm 1.0.20** for pre-trained models (EfficientNet, ResNet, etc.)
- **Flask 3.0.0** for the API server
- **scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn** for evaluation and visualization
- All other required dependencies

## 🚀 Apple Silicon GPU Support

Good news! Your Mac has **Apple Silicon GPU (MPS)** which will accelerate training significantly (5-10x faster than CPU).

The training script is now configured to automatically use:
- **MPS (Apple Silicon)** ✅ Available on your system
- **CUDA** (NVIDIA GPU) - Not available
- **CPU** - Fallback option

## 📋 Next Steps

### Step 1: Organize Your Dataset

You mentioned you have healthy and unhealthy skin images downloaded. Now you need to organize them:

```bash
cd backend

# Replace these paths with YOUR actual image directories
python prepare_data.py \
  --mode binary \
  --healthy_dir /path/to/your/healthy/images \
  --unhealthy_dir /path/to/your/unhealthy/images \
  --target_dir data
```

**Example** (update with your actual paths):
```bash
python prepare_data.py \
  --mode binary \
  --healthy_dir ~/Downloads/healthy_skin_images \
  --unhealthy_dir ~/Downloads/unhealthy_skin_images \
  --target_dir data
```

This will:
- Create `data/train/`, `data/val/`, `data/test/` directories
- Split your images: 70% training, 15% validation, 15% testing
- Show you how many images are in each category

### Step 2: Train Your Model

Once data is organized:

```bash
cd backend
python train.py --num_classes 2 --epochs 50
```

Training on Apple Silicon should take **20-40 minutes** for 50 epochs (depending on dataset size).

### Step 3: Evaluate & Use

After training:
```bash
# Evaluate on test set
python evaluate.py

# Start the Flask API
python app.py
```

Your trained model will be at: `backend/models/pt_skin_model.pth`

## 💡 Important Commands

### Always Activate Virtual Environment

When you open a new terminal, activate the virtual environment first:
```bash
cd /Users/klenka/HackRUF25
source venv/bin/activate
```

You'll see `(venv)` in your prompt when it's active.

### Install More Packages (if needed)

```bash
# Make sure venv is activated
pip install package-name
```

### Find Your Downloaded Images

If you're not sure where your images are:
```bash
# Search in Downloads
find ~/Downloads -type d -name "*skin*" -o -name "*healthy*" 2>/dev/null

# List recent downloads
ls -lt ~/Downloads | head -20
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If `pip` not found again
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### If Python packages not found
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-training.txt
```

### MPS (GPU) Issues
If you get MPS errors during training, fall back to CPU:
```python
# Edit train.py, line 55:
device = "cpu"
```

## 📚 Documentation

- **QUICKSTART.md** - Simple 3-step guide
- **TRAINING_SETUP.md** - Detailed training documentation
- **backend/EXAMPLE_SETUP.sh** - Automated setup script

## ⚡ Quick Test

Test that everything works:
```bash
cd backend
python -c "import torch; print(f'Device: {torch.device(\"mps\" if torch.backends.mps.is_available() else \"cpu\")}')"
```

You should see: `Device: mps` (Apple Silicon GPU)

## 🎯 What You Should Do Now

1. **Find your downloaded images** (healthy and unhealthy)
2. **Run `prepare_data.py`** with paths to your images
3. **Run `train.py`** to start training
4. Check `logs/` folder for training progress plots

Good luck with your training! 🚀

**Note**: TensorFlow and ONNX were intentionally not installed due to dependency conflicts. The training script uses PyTorch which is sufficient. You can add TensorFlow later if needed for the multi-model ensemble in app.py.
