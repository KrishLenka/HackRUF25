## 🔄 What Was Updated

### 1. Training Script (`train.py`)
- ✅ Default classes changed from 2 → 25
- ✅ Apple Silicon GPU (MPS) support added
- ✅ Auto-discovers classes from dataset

### 2. Flask API (`app.py`)
- ✅ Updated with all 25 class names (alphabetically sorted)
- ✅ Intelligent advice generation system
- ✅ Specific medical advice for high-risk conditions:
  - **Melanoma** → URGENT dermatology
  - **Malignant Lesions** → URGENT evaluation
  - **Healthy Skin** → Routine monitoring

## 🚀 Ready to Train!

### Start Training Now

```bash
cd backend
python train.py --num_classes 25 --epochs 50
```

### Training Options

```bash
# Use a larger model for better accuracy
python train.py --num_classes 25 --model efficientnet_b3 --epochs 50

# Adjust batch size (if memory issues)
python train.py --num_classes 25 --batch_size 16 --epochs 50

# Faster testing (fewer epochs)
python train.py --num_classes 25 --epochs 20
```

### Expected Training Time

With your Apple Silicon GPU (MPS):
- **~40-60 minutes** for 50 epochs (batch size 32)
- **~20-30 minutes** for 25 epochs
- Training on CPU would take 4-6 hours

### What Happens During Training

1. **Loads images** from train/val directories
2. **Applies augmentation** (flips, rotations, color jitter)
3. **Trains model** with early stopping
4. **Saves best model** to `models/pt_skin_model.pth`
5. **Generates plots** in `logs/` folder:
   - Loss curves
   - Accuracy curves
   - Confusion matrix
   - Classification report

## 📊 After Training

### 1. Evaluate Performance

```bash
python evaluate.py
```

This generates:
- Confusion matrix (25x25)
- ROC curves for each class
- Precision-recall curves
- Per-class metrics
- Overall accuracy

Expected results with good data:
- **Top-1 Accuracy**: 70-85%
- **Top-3 Accuracy**: 85-95%
- Higher for classes with more data (Eczema, Psoriasis)
- Lower for rare conditions (Urticaria Hives: 181 samples)

### 2. Start the API Server

```bash
python app.py
```

Server runs at `http://localhost:5000`

### 3. Test Predictions

```bash
# Test with an image
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/predict \
  -F "file=@path/to/skin/image.jpg"
```

Response format:
```json
{
  "prediction": "Melanoma Skin Cancer Nevi and Moles",
  "final_confidence": 0.87,
  "advice": {
    "short": "URGENT: Possible melanoma...",
    "urgency": "high",
    "recommendation": "Schedule URGENT dermatology appointment"
  },
  "ensemble_avg_probs": [0.01, 0.02, ..., 0.87, ...],
  "per_model_predictions": [...]
}
```

## 🎯 Tips for Best Results

### 1. Class Imbalance
Some classes have 1,195 images, others only 181. Consider:
- Using **class weights** during training
- **Oversampling** rare classes
- **Undersampling** common classes

Add to `train.py`:
```python
# Calculate class weights
from sklearn.utils.class_weight import compute_class_weight
class_weights = compute_class_weight('balanced', 
                                     classes=np.unique(labels), 
                                     y=labels)
```

### 2. Data Augmentation
Already enabled with:
- Random flips (horizontal/vertical)
- Random rotation (±20°)
- Color jitter
- Random affine transforms

### 3. Model Selection
- **efficientnet_b0**: Fast, 5M params, good baseline
- **efficientnet_b3**: Better accuracy, 12M params
- **resnet50**: Classic choice, 25M params

### 4. Transfer Learning
Using ImageNet pretrained weights by default. This helps significantly for medical images.

## 🔍 Monitoring Training

Watch for:
1. **Loss decreasing** steadily
2. **Val accuracy improving** (target: 70-80%)
3. **No overfitting** (train acc >> val acc means overfitting)
4. **Early stopping** triggers if no improvement

Example output:
```
Epoch 1/50
Training: 100%|████████| 442/442 [01:30<00:00]
Train Loss: 2.8234 | Train Acc: 28.50%
Val Loss: 2.5123 | Val Acc: 32.00%
✓ Saved best model

Epoch 10/50
Train Loss: 1.2341 | Train Acc: 68.20%
Val Loss: 1.4523 | Val Acc: 62.50%
✓ Saved best model

Epoch 25/50
Train Loss: 0.7234 | Train Acc: 82.10%
Val Loss: 1.1234 | Val Acc: 73.20%
✓ Saved best model
```
